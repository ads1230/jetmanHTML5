# Jetman

A fast, one‑thumb, portrait‑mode HTML5 arcade twist on the traditional helicopter game.
Navigate Jetman through the cave walls whilst dodging floating obstacles.
Touch the walls or a block and it’s **game over**.

## Objective
- **Survive** as long as possible by threading the tunnel and avoiding all obstacles.
- **Score** accumulates automatically over time (faster on higher difficulties).
- Beat your **High Score** (saved locally in your browser).

# Jetman

A fast moving, one‑thumb, HTML5 arcade twist on the traditional helicopter game.
Navigate Jetman through the cave walls whilst dodging floating obstacles. Touch either and it’s **game over**.

## Objective
- **Survive** as long as possible by threading through the tunnel and avoiding all obstacles.
- Your **score** accumulates automatically over time (faster on higher difficulties). Challenge yourself with every run to beat your previous **high score**.
